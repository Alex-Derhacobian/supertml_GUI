# GUI for Vision Tasks on Tabular Machine Learning Dataset (download pretrained model below)
Fraud Detection GUI for SuperTML

This provides an interactive GUI to demonstrate the SuperTML tabular machine learning method (Sun et. al). We have trained the SuperTML model on the classic
credit card fraud detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and achieved state of the art results with a 98.8% test accuracy. 

This GUI allows the user to enter custom or randomized inputs, view the SuperTML image produced for feeding into the model, and see whether or not such a 
transaction would be fraudulent activity or not. See example window below:
